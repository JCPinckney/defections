## The Motivating Question {.smaller}

> When do supporters of authoritarian and democratic backsliding regimes cease to support their leaders? When do they [**defect**]{.highlight-red}?

. . .

- Defection is [**consequential**]{.highlight-red} — it shapes regime stability and transformation
- Yet we lack a [**unifying framework**]{.highlight-red} for understanding defection across contexts

. . .

**Goal:** Develop a framework to guide research and inform practitioners seeking to advance, defend, and repair democracy.


## Power Rests on Obedience {.smaller}

All political regimes rely on key groups and institutions to provide power and resources [@sharp-politics-1973]:

. . .

- [**Security forces**]{.highlight-red} → capacity for repression
- [**Media**]{.highlight-red} → regime narratives and public compliance
- [**Citizens**]{.highlight-red} → taxes, obedience, legitimacy
- [**Business elites**]{.highlight-red} → economic resources
- [**Legislators & bureaucrats**]{.highlight-red} → institutional functioning

. . .




## What Is Defection? {.smaller}

[**Defection**]{.highlight-red} is any instance in which a regime supporter [**substantively decreases**]{.highlight-red} their level of regime support.

. . .

Examples:

- Soldiers refuse to open fire on demonstrators
- Government attorneys refuse politically-motivated prosecutions
- Legislators resign or vote against their party leadership
- Businesses withdraw financial support

. . .

Defection is especially crucial in processes of [**nonviolent resistance**]{.highlight-red}, whose logic rests not on eliminating opponents but on *shifting them to one's side* [@chenoweth-why-2011].

- [**Defection**]{.highlight-red} = any leftward movement *beginning* in active or passive support


## Scope Conditions {.smaller}

This project focuses on defection within:

. . .

[**1. Authoritarian and democratic backsliding regimes**]{.highlight-red}

- Repression makes defection far riskier than in healthy democracies [@davenport-state-2007]
- Different risk environments → different motivators
- Core motivation: understanding how to protect, repair, and advance democracy

. . .

[**2. The contemporary world (post–Cold War)**]{.highlight-red}

- Modern authoritarianism relies more on pseudo-democratic institutions, less on brute repression [@guriev-informational-2019]
- Democratic backsliding today is gradual, centered on executive aggrandizement under a veneer of legality [@bermeo-democratic-2016; @riedl-pathways-2024]


## What Do We Already Know? {.smaller}

Different forms of defection have been studied in **isolation**:

::: {.incremental}
- **Military/security defection** during civil resistance [@nepstad-mutiny-2013; @grewal-military-2019; @dahl-disaggregating-2026]
- **Individual Elite defection** from autocratic rgeimes [@reuter-economic-2011; @reuter-elite-2019; @delrio-strategic-2022; @slater-revolutions-2009]
- **Mass voter defection** in electoral autocracies [@hale-who-2017; @tertytchnaya-protests-2020]

## Defection Has Multi-Faceted, Obscure Motivations {.smaller}

People defect for many reasons — often simultaneously:

- [**Rational self-interest**]{.highlight-red} (material utility maximization)
- [**Moral conviction**]{.highlight-red} [@pearlman-moral-2018]
- [**Changing social norms**]{.highlight-red} of appropriate behavior

. . .

These motivations interact:

- Material interests are easier to advance with moral justification
- Principled commitment is easier to sustain when materially beneficial

. . .

**Key caution:** Self-reported explanations are one data source among many, not definitive answers. People construct narratives to shape self and collective image [@nisbett-telling-1977].


## Defection Is Behavioral {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.incremental}
- Defection is defined not by what people [**think**]{.highlight-red} but by what they [**do**]{.highlight-red}.
- There must be an [**observable behavioral change**]{.highlight-red} vis-à-vis the regime for us to say defection has occurred
- [But **speech** counts as behavior!]{.highlight-red}
- What counts as defection depends what constitutes [*loyalty*]{.highlight-red} for that individual or group.

## Defection Takes Many Forms {.smaller}

<br>

|  | [**Breaking**]{.highlight-red} (exit/outside) | [**Binding**]{.highlight-red} (voice/inside) |
|---|---|---|
| [**Speaking**]{.highlight-red} | Public condemnation | Private disapproval |
| [**Acting**]{.highlight-red} | Joining a demonstration | Creating internal reforms |
| [**Standing in the way**]{.highlight-red} | Disobeying orders | Foot-dragging |

<br>

. . .

- [**Breaking**]{.highlight-red} severs ties with the regime (visible, explicit)
- [**Binding**]{.highlight-red} maintains identity within regime while applying internal pressure (quiet, behind-the-scenes)
- Defection over time likely begins with **binding** → then **breaking**

:::


## Defection Requires a Way Out {.smaller}

Regime supporters typically won't defect without perceiving an [**acceptable post-defection future**.]{.highlight-red}

. . .

- Corrupt business elites fear both losing benefits *and* opposition animosity [@sinanoglu-autocrats-2025]
- Without viable post-defection pathways, defection is particularly rare [@langston-breaking-2002]
- Eliminating alternatives is a key strategy of authoritarian control

. . .

**Implication for resistance campaigns:**

- Create [alternative institutions]{.highlight-red}
- Negotiate [exit plans]{.highlight-red}
- Promote an [**inclusive vision**]{.highlight-red} of a post-regime future where potential defectors can see themselves


## It's Not What You Know, It's Who You Know {.smaller}

Defection is driven by **social connections** and a "logic of appropriateness" [@march-institutional-1998].

. . .

- Positive connections to individuals/groups with lower regime loyalty → reduced loyalty, increased defection probability
- When group boundaries blur (supporters see their group as including opponents) → [in-group]{.highlight-red} loyalty no longer implies [regime]{.highlight-red} loyalty

. . .

**For resistance campaigns, defection is more likely when:**

1. The campaign increases [**social connections**]{.highlight-red} to regime supporters
2. The campaign signals that [**dissent is more widespread and durable**]{.highlight-red} than previously believed


## But Material Consequences Matter {.smaller}

Social connections are important but likely insufficient. Defection in authoritarian contexts is **high-risk, high-cost**, thus may only occur when material costs of defection are lower than costs of loyalty.

. . .

**Tension:** Social vs. material logics of sparking defection

. . .

*Example:* A business supporting an authoritarian leader

- [**Social**]{.highlight-red} approach: Patronize the business → build connections → social logic of appropriateness
- [**Material pressure**]{.highlight-red} approach: Boycott → cut connections → heighten material costs of loyalty

. . .

Campaigns are likely to be effective when they [**sequence**]{.highlight-red} social and material strategies — material pressure may be most effective when seen as a temporary break in a relationship that can be restored.


## Step Size and Regime Type {.smaller}

[**Little steps are easier than big steps**]{.highlight-red}

- Most common defection: passive support → neutrality
- Jumps of multiple levels (active support → active opposition) are rare

. . .

[**But authoritarianism can make defection all-or-nothing**]{.highlight-red}

- Authoritarian regimes punish even modest loyalty declines with severe repression
- This accumulates large numbers of false supporters [@kuran-now-1991]
- When they defect, they do so dramatically

. . .

[**Hypothesis:**]{.highlight-red} Defection scale is directly related to degree of authoritarianism. More open → small, frequent defections. More authoritarian → rare but large and abrupt.

## Gains and Losses {.smaller}

[**What is gained and what is lost from thinking of defections in this high-level, unified way?**]{.highlight-red}

. . .

*Some considerations:*

- Gain: [Cross-pollination]{.highlight-red} of insights across fragmented literatures
- Gain: [Unified language]{.highlight-red} for practitioners and researchers
- Loss: [Context-specific dynamics]{.highlight-red} may be obscured
- Loss: Risk of [over-generalizing]{.highlight-red} across diverse phenomena


## Evaluating the Assumptions {.smaller}

[**Which assumptions are clear/unclear or helpful/unhelpful? Are there contradictions?**]{.highlight-red}

The five assumptions:

1. Defection can be [**individual or collective**]{.highlight-red}
2. Defection is [**social**]{.highlight-red}
3. Defection has [**multi-faceted, obscure motivations**]{.highlight-red}
4. Defection is [**behavioral**]{.highlight-red}
5. Defection [**takes many context-specific forms**]{.highlight-red}



## What's Missing? {.smaller}

[**What additional assumptions are necessary to understand defections?**]{.highlight-red}

. . .

*Some possible areas to explore:*

:::{.incremental style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px"}
- Role of [**emotions**]{.highlight-red} (fear, hope, shame, anger) as distinct from rational calculation or moral conviction?
- [**Multi-dimensional Loyalty**]{.highlight-red} - this framework treats regime loyalty as unidimensional. Is that a problem? How should we think about the different directions loyalty can go?
- [**Reversibility**]{.highlight-red} — defection can be temporary. How should we think about its potential to be reversed?
:::

## Other Critiques? {.smaller}

:::{.incremental style="line-height: 2.5;"}
- What are the [**methodological challenges**]{.highlight-red} of studying defection given the framework?
- Are the [**scope conditions**]{.highlight-red} (authoritarian + backsliding regimes) too broad or too narrow?
- How does this framework relate to [**adjacent concepts**]{.highlight-red} (exit/voice/loyalty, methods of nonviolent action)?
